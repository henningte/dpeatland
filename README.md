dpeatland is an R package that has the aim to provide a comprehensive
and easily to access data collection on peatland-related variables
useful to construct process models for peatlands.

dpeatland is designed as community-based project, meaning that everybody
can contribute and benefit from this project. Learn more about [why you

to dpeatland and [how you can use the
data](https://henningte.github.io/dpeatland/articles/a05-How-to-access-data.html)\!

dpeatland is part of my PhD project. I want to be fully transparent on
[what I plan to do with the
data](https://henningte.github.io/dpeatland/articles/a02-What-I-plan-to-do-with-the-data.html).
