dpeatland is part of my PhD project. One of my goals is to facilitate data integration into dynamic peatland models to model long-term carbon accumulation. In dpeatland, I collect all data I plan to use to calibrate a peatland model.

I will **publish this model** so that future projects can benefit from their capabilities. <!--For this, I've created the R package [irpeat](https://github.com/henningte/irpeat/). [---todo: update]-->

The aim is to provide an open and easily accessible mechanistic model for long-term carbon accumulation in peatlands that can be used by other scientists, for example to discover new hypotheses. <!-- See the [GitHub repository for odpm]() if you are interested.-->

Since these tasks are a core part of my PhD project and I am expected to contribute the main part to it, there is only a limited extent to which collaborations on this work are possible.
