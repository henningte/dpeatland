@article{Aeschbacher.2010,
 abstract = {Two electrochemical methods to assess the redox properties of humic substances (HS) are presented: direct electrochemical reduction (DER) on glassy carbon working electrodes (WE) and mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) and oxidation (MEO) using organic radicals to facilitate electron transfer between HS and the WE. DER allows for continuous monitoring of electron and proton transfer to HS by chronocoulometry and automated acid titration, respectively, and of changes in bulk HS redox potential E(h). Leonardite Humic Acid (LHA) showed an H(+)/e(-) ratio of unity and a decrease in potential from E(h) = +0.18 to -0.23 V upon transfer of 822 mumol(e-) g(LHA)(-1) at pH 7, consistent with quinones as major redox-active functional moieties in LHA. MER and MEO quantitatively detected electrons in LHA samples that were prereduced by DER to different extents. MER and MEO therefore accurately quantify the redox state of HS. Cyclic DER and O(2)-reoxidation revealed that electron transfer to LHA was largely reversible. However, LHA contained a small pool of moieties that were not reoxidized, likely due to endergonic first electron transfer to O(2). Electron accepting capacities of 13 different HS, determined by MER, strongly correlated with their C/H ratios and aromaticities and with previously published values, which, however, were a factor of 3 smaller due to methodological limitations.},

 abstract = {Humic substances play a key role in biogeochemical and pollutant redox reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the proton and electron transfer equilibria of the reducible moieties in different humic acids (HA). Cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrated that diquat and ethylviologen mediated electron transfer between carbon working electrodes and HA. These compounds were used also to facilitate attainment of redox equilibria between redox electrodes and HA in potentiometric E(h) measurements. Bulk electrolysis of HA combined with pH-stat acid titration demonstrated that electron transfer to the reducible moieties in HA also resulted in proton uptake, suggesting decreasing reduction potentials E(h) of HA with increasing pH. This was confirmed by potentiometric E(h)-pH titrations of HA at different redox states. E(h) measurements of HA samples prereduced to different redox states by bulk electrolysis revealed reducible moieties in HA that cover a wide range of apparent standard reduction potentials at pH 7 from E(h)(0)* = +0.15 to -0.3 V. Modeling revealed an overall increase in the relative abundance of reducible moieties with decreasing E(h). The wide range of HA is consistent with its involvement in numerous environmental electron transfer reactions under various redox conditions.},

@article{Aeschbacher.2012,
 abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are heterogeneous, redox-active organic macromolecules. While electron transfer to and from HS under reducing conditions is well investigated, comparatively little is known on the electron donating (i.e., antioxidant) properties of HS under oxic conditions. In this work, the electron donating capacities (EDCs) of terrestrial and aquatic HS were quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation over a wide range of pH values and applied redox potentials (E(h)) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as an electron transfer mediator. Electrochemical oxidation of three model humic acids (HAs) was largely irreversible, and the EDCs of these HAs increased with increasing E(h) and pH. These results suggest that HS contain a wide variety of moieties that are oxidized at different potentials and that, upon oxidation, release protons and undergo irreversible follow-up reactions. At a given pH and E(h), the EDCs of the HS correlated well with their titrated phenol contents suggesting phenolic moieties as major electron donating groups in HS. Comparing the EDCs of 15 HS with their electron accepting capacities (EACs), aquatic HS had higher EDCs and lower EACs than terrestrial HS of comparable aromaticities. These results indicate that oxidative transformation of HS in the environment results in a depletion of electron donating phenolic moieties with antioxidant properties relative to the electron accepting quinone moieties.},

 abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool in protein science due to its sensitivity to changes in secondary structure or conformation. In order to take advantage of the full power of infrared spectroscopy in structural studies of proteins, complex band contours, such as the amide I band, have to be decomposed into their main component bands, a process referred to as curve fitting. In this paper, we report on an improved curve fitting approach in which absorption spectra and second derivative spectra are fitted simultaneously. Our approach, which we name co-fitting, leads to a more reliable modelling of the experimental data because it uses more spectral information than the standard approach of fitting only the absorption spectrum. It also avoids that the fitting routine becomes trapped in local minima. We have tested the proposed approach using infrared absorption spectra of three mixed α/β proteins with different degrees of spectral overlap in the amide I region: ribonuclease A, pyruvate kinase, and aconitase.},

 abstract = {Information about electron-transfer reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is lacking. We determined electron acceptor and donor capacities (EAC and EDC) of a peat humic acid and an untreated peat DOM by electrochemical reduction and reduction with metallic Zn and H2S (EAC), and by oxidation with complexed ferric iron (EDC) at pH 6.5. DOC concentrations (10-100 mg L(-1)) and pH values (4.5-8) were varied in selected experiments. EAC reached up to 6.2 mequiv x (g C)(-1) and EDC reached up to 1.52 mequiv-(g C)(-1). EDC decreased with pH and conversion of chelated to colloidal iron, and the electron-transfer capacity (ETC) was controlled by the redox potential Eh of the reactant (ETC = 1.016x Eh - 0.138; R(2) = 0.87; p = 0.05). The kinetics could be adequately described by pseudo first-order rate laws, one or two DOM pools, and time constants ranging from 2.1 x 10(-3) d-1 to 1.9 x 10(-2) d(-1) for the fast pool. Reactions were completed after 24-160 h depending on the redox couple applied. The results indicate that DOM may act as a redox buffer over electrochemical potentials ranging from -0.9 to +1.0 V.},

@article{Bengtsson.2016,
 abstract = {Peat mosses (Sphagnum) largely govern carbon sequestration in Northern Hemisphere peatlands. We investigated functional traits related to growth and decomposition in Sphagnum species. We tested the importance of environment and phylogeny in driving species traits and investigated trade-offs among them. We selected 15 globally important Sphagnum species, representing four sections (subgenera) and a range of peatland habitats. We measured rates of photosynthesis and decomposition in standard laboratory conditions as measures of innate growth and decay potential, and related this to realized growth, production, and decomposition in their natural habitats. In general, we found support for a trade-off between measures of growth and decomposition. However, the relationships are not strong, with r ranging between 0.24 and 0.45 for different measures of growth versus decomposition. Using photosynthetic rate to predict decomposition in standard conditions yielded R (2)~=~0.20. Habitat and section (phylogeny) affected the traits and the trade-offs. In a wet year, species from sections Cuspidata and Sphagnum had the highest production, but in a dry year, differences among species, sections, and habitats evened out. Cuspidata species in general produced easily decomposable litter, but their decay in the field was hampered, probably due to near-surface anoxia in their wet habitats. In a principal components analysis, PCA, photosynthetic capacity, production, and laboratory decomposition acted in the same direction. The species were imperfectly clustered according to vegetation type and phylogeny, so that some species clustered with others in the same section, whereas others clustered more clearly with others from similar vegetation types. Our study includes a wider range of species and habitats than previous trait analyses in Sphagnum and shows that while the previously described growth-decay trade-off exists, it is far from perfect. We therefore suggest that our species-specific trait measures offer opportunities for improvements of peatland ecosystem models. Innate qualities measured in laboratory conditions translate differently to field responses. Most dramatically, fast-growing species could only realize their potential in a wet year. The same species decompose fast in laboratory, but their decomposition was more retarded in the field than that of other species. These relationships are crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of peatland communities.},

 abstract = {In large regions of Europe and North America, peatlands have been exposed to elevated rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. We investigated the fate of experimentally added N (NH(4)(15)NO3) at two different N loads (1.2 and 4.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) and water tables (1 and 32 cm) in intact cores from two peatlands, located in Central and Eastern Canada. The sites receive an estimated total N load of 0.6 g m(-2) a(-1) and 1.5 g m(-2) yr(-1), excluding nitrogen fixation. In all treatments, experimentally added nitrate (NO(3-)) was fully (96-99{\%}) and ammonium (NH(4+)) mostly (81-97{\%}) retained by the plant cover, mainly consisting of Sphagnum mosses, or in the unsaturated zone below. However, on average only 48{\%} of the (15)N were recovered from the plant cover, and substantial amounts were found in depth layers of 2-6 cm (21-46{\%}) and 8-12 cm (1.4-10.8{\%}) below the moss surface. The amount of (15)N retained also significantly decreased with a lower water table from 56+/-9{\%} to 40+/-10{\%}. These findings document a substantial mobility of N, particularly during water table drawdown. Analysis of (15)N by a sequential diffusion procedure revealed a transfer of (15)N from NO(3-) into NH(4+) and dissolved organic N (DON), but the contents of (15)N in these pools accounted for less than 1{\%} of the total N, natural background subtracted. The mass flux of dissolved (15)N into the peat was small compared to the total mass flux of (15)N. The accumulation of (15)N in the bulk peat must have been caused by a mechanism that was not investigated, possibly by transport of particulate organic N.},

High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set.
RESULTS
We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising: for orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for >90{\%} of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.},

 abstract = {Peat bogs have historically represented exceptional carbon (C) sinks because of their extremely low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation of plant remnants as peat. Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs as a consequence of human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed litter peat samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from approximately 0.2 to 2 g.m(-2).yr(-1). We found that enhanced decomposition rates for material accumulated under higher atmospheric N supplies resulted in higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and dissolved organic carbon release. The increased N availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of litter peat quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity. Although some uncertainty remains about whether decay-resistant Sphagnum will continue to dominate litter peat, our data indicate that, even without such changes, increased N deposition poses a serious risk to our valuable peatland C sinks.},

 abstract = {Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum constitute the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in 11 European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the context of the global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate litter peat decomposition.},

 abstract = {The ongoing expansion of shrub cover in response to climate change represents a unique opportunity to explore the link between soil microbial communities and vegetation changes. This link is particularly important in peatlands where shrub expansion is expected to feed back negatively on the carbon sink capacity of these ecosystems. Microbial community structure and function were measured seasonally in four peatlands located along an altitude gradient representing a natural gradient of climate and associated vascular plant abundance. We show that increased soil temperature and reduced water content are associated with greater vascular plant biomass, in particular that of ericoids, and that this, in turn, is correlated with greater microbial biomass. More specifically, microbial community structure is characterized by an increasing dominance of fungi over bacteria with improved soil oxygenation. We also found that the carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry of microbial biomass differs in relation to soil microbial community structure and that this is ultimately associated with a different investment in extracellular enzymatic activity. Our findings highlight the fact that the determination of the structural identity of microbial communities can help to explain the biogeochemical dynamics of organic matter and provide a better understanding of ecosystem response to environmental changes.},

 abstract = {Extreme climate events are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Their ecological impacts, particularly on carbon cycling, can differ in relation to ecosystem sensitivity. Peatlands, being characterized by peat accumulation under waterlogged conditions, can be particularly sensitive to climate extremes if the climate event increases soil oxygenation. However, a mechanistic understanding of peatland responses to persistent climate extremes is still lacking, particularly in terms of aboveground-belowground feedback. Here, we present the results of a transplantation experiment of peat mesocosms from high to low altitude in order to simulate, during 3~years, a mean annual temperature c. 5~°C higher and a mean annual precipitation c. 60{\%} lower. Specifically, we aim at understanding the intensity of changes for a set of biogeochemical processes and their feedback on carbon accumulation. In the transplanted mesocosms, plant productivity showed a species-specific response depending on plant growth forms, with a significant decrease (c. 60{\%}) in peat moss productivity. Soil respiration almost doubled and Q10 halved in the transplanted mesocosms in combination with an increase in activity of soil enzymes. Spectroscopic characterization of peat chemistry in the transplanted mesocosms confirmed the deepening of soil oxygenation which, in turn, stimulated microbial decomposition. After 3~years, soil carbon stock increased only in the control mesocosms whereas a reduction in mean annual carbon accumulation of c. 30{\%} was observed in the transplanted mesocosms. Based on the above information, a structural equation~model was built to provide a mechanistic understanding of the causal connections between peat moisture, vegetation response, soil respiration and carbon accumulation. This study identifies, in the feedback between plant and microbial responses, the primary pathways explaining the reduction in carbon accumulation in response to recurring climate extremes in peat soils.},

 abstract = {Peat bogs play a large role in the global sequestration of C, and are often dominated by different Sphagnum species. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in peat bogs will respond to global warming. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effect of four temperature treatments (11.2, 14.7, 18.0 and 21.4 degrees C) on the growth of four Sphagnum species: S. fuscum and S. balticum from a site in northern Sweden and S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum from a site in southern Sweden. In addition, three combinations of these species were made to study the effect of temperature on competition. We found that all species increased their height increment and biomass production with an increase in temperature, while bulk densities were lower at higher temperatures. The hollow species S. cuspidatum was the least responsive species, whereas the hummock species S. fuscum increased biomass production 13-fold from the lowest to the highest temperature treatment in monocultures. Nutrient concentrations were higher at higher temperatures, especially N concentrations of S. fuscum and S. balticum increased compared to field values. Competition between S. cuspidatum and S. magellanicum was not influenced by temperature. The mixtures of S. balticum with S. fuscum and S. balticum with S. magellanicum showed that S. balticum was the stronger competitor, but it lost competitive advantage in the highest temperature treatment. These findings suggest that species abundances will shift in response to global warming, particularly at northern sites where hollow species will lose competitive strength relative to hummock species and southern species.},

One major challenge in its utilization is that the majority of this carbon is trapped in the recalcitrant structural polymers of the plant cell wall. Deconstruction of lignin is a key step in the processing of biomass to useful monomers but remains challenging. Microbial systems can provide molecular information on lignin depolymerization as they have evolved to break lignin down using metalloenzyme-dependent radical pathways. Both fungi and bacteria have been observed to metabolize lignin; however, their differential reactivity with this substrate indicates that they may utilize different chemical strategies for its breakdown. This review will discuss recent advances in studying bacterial lignin degradation as an approach to exploring greater diversity in the environment.},

In this work, we present MetExtract II, a software toolbox for detection of biologically derived compounds. It exploits SIL-specific isotope patterns and elution profiles in LC-HRMS(/MS) data. The toolbox consists of three complementary modules: M1 (AllExtract) uses mixtures of uniformly highly isotope-enriched and native biological samples for selective detection of the entire accessible metabolome. M2 (TracExtract) is particularly suited to probe the metabolism of endogenous or exogenous secondary metabolites and facilitates the untargeted screening of tracer derivatives from concurrently metabolized native and uniformly labeled tracer substances. With M3 (FragExtract), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragments of corresponding native and uniformly labeled ions are evaluated and automatically assigned with putative sum formulas. Generated results can be graphically illustrated and exported as a comprehensive data matrix that contains all detected pairs of native and labeled metabolite ions that can be used for database queries, metabolome-wide internal standardization, and statistical analysis. The software, associated documentation, and sample data sets are freely available for noncommercial use at http://metabolomics-ifa.boku.ac.at/metextractII .},

 abstract = {Studying the flow of chemical moieties through the complex set of metabolic reactions that happen in the cell is essential to understanding the alterations in homeostasis that occur in disease. Recently, LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics and isotopically labeled metabolites have been used to facilitate the unbiased mapping of labeled moieties through metabolic pathways. However, due to the complexity of the resulting experimental data sets few computational tools are available for data analysis. Here we introduce geoRge, a novel computational approach capable of analyzing untargeted LC/MS data from stable isotope-labeling experiments. geoRge is written in the open language R and runs on the output structure of the XCMS package, which is in widespread use. As opposed to the few existing tools, which use labeled samples to track stable isotopes by iterating over all MS signals using the theoretical mass difference between the light and heavy isotopes, geoRge uses unlabeled and labeled biologically equivalent samples to compare isotopic distributions in the mass spectra. Isotopically enriched compounds change their isotopic distribution as compared to unlabeled compounds. This is directly reflected in a number of new m/z peaks and higher intensity peaks in the mass spectra of labeled samples relative to the unlabeled equivalents. The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative quantification capabilities of geoRge are demonstrated by the analysis of LC/MS data from a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) grown on normal and high glucose concentrations mimicking diabetic retinopathy conditions in vitro. In addition, we compared the results of geoRge with the outcome of X(13)CMS, since both approaches rely entirely on XCMS parameters for feature selection, namely m/z and retention time values. To ensure data traceability and reproducibility, and enabling for comparison with other existing and future approaches, raw LC/MS files have been deposited in MetaboLights (MTBLS213) and geoRge is available as an R script at https://github.com/jcapelladesto/geoRge.},

This is a particular concern in cool, wet northern peatlands that could experience warmer, drier conditions. Here we show that climate, ecosystem processes and food chains combine to influence the population performance of species in British blanket bogs. Our peatland process model accurately predicts water-table depth, which predicts abundance of craneflies (keystone invertebrates), which in turn predicts observed abundances and population persistence of three ecosystem-specialist bird species that feed on craneflies during the breeding season. Climate change projections suggest that falling water tables could cause 56-81{\%} declines in cranefly abundance and, hence, 15-51{\%} reductions in the abundances of these birds by 2051-2080. We conclude that physical (precipitation, temperature and topography), biophysical (evapotranspiration and desiccation of invertebrates) and ecological (food chains) processes combine to determine the distributions and survival of ecosystem-specialist predators.},

To better exploit the potential of these technologies, there is a need to develop more efficient and accessible analysis workflows and focus more efforts on the distinct challenge of mapping submerged vegetation. We present a straightforward workflow developed to monitor emergent and submerged invasive water soldier (Stratiotes aloides) in shallow waters of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada. The main elements of the workflow are: (1) collection of radiometrically calibrated multispectral imagery including a near-infrared band; (2) multistage segmentation of the imagery involving an initial separation of above-water from submerged features; and (3) automated classification of features with a supervised machine-learning classifier. The approach yielded excellent classification accuracy for emergent features (overall accuracy = 92{\%}; kappa = 88{\%}; water soldier producer’s accuracy = 92{\%}; user’s accuracy = 91{\%}) and good accuracy for submerged features (overall accuracy = 84{\%}; kappa = 75{\%}; water soldier producer’s accuracy = 71{\%}; user’s accuracy = 84{\%}). The workflow employs off-the-shelf graphical software tools requiring no programming or coding, and could therefore be used by anyone with basic GIS and image analysis skills for a potentially wide variety of aquatic vegetation monitoring operations.},

 abstract = {The elucidation of the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and natural organic matter (NOM) can help one to better understand the fates, features, and environmental impacts of NPs. In this work, two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) correlation spectroscopy (CoS) assisted by the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) method is used to explore the interaction mechanism of humic acid (HA) with TiO2 NPs at a molecular level. The results show that the C═O bonds (carboxylate, amide, quinone, or ketone) and C-O bonds (phenol, aliphatic C-OH, and polysaccharide) of HA play important roles in their interaction with TiO2 NPs. The adsorption process of HA onto the surface of TiO2 NPs is different from the bonding process of the two species in solution. The forms of the relevant groups of HA and their consequent reaction with TiO2 NPs are affected to a great extent by the solution pH and the surface charge of NPs. The 2D-FTIR-CoS method is found to be able to construct a comprehensive picture about the NOM-TiO2 NPs interaction process. This 2D-FTIR-CoS approach might also be used to probe other complicated interaction processes in natural and engineered environments.},

 abstract = {Sphagnum mosses mediate long-term carbon accumulation in peatlands. Given their functional role as keystone species, it is important to consider their responses to ecological gradients and environmental changes through the production of phenolics. We compared the extent to which Sphagnum phenolic production was dependent on species, microhabitats and season, and how surrounding dwarf shrubs responded to Sphagnum phenolics. We evaluated the phenolic profiles of aqueous extracts of Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum magellanicum over a 6-month period in two microhabitats (wet lawns versus dry hummocks) in a French peatland. Phenolic profiles of water-soluble extracts were measured by UHPLC-QTOF-MS. Andromeda polifolia mycorrhizal colonization was quantified by assessing the intensity of global root cortex colonization. Phenolic profiles of both Sphagnum mosses were species-, season- and microhabitat- dependant. Sphagnum-derived acids were the phenolics mostly recovered; relative quantities were 2.5-fold higher in S. fallax than in S. magellanicum. Microtopography and vascular plant cover strongly influenced phenolic profiles, especially for minor metabolites present in low abundance. Higher mycorrhizal colonization of A. polifolia was found in lawns as compared to hummocks. Mycorrhizal abundance, in contrast to environmental parameters, was correlated with production of minor phenolics in S. fallax. Our results highlight the close interaction between mycorrhizae such as those colonizing A. polifolia and the release of Sphagnum phenolic metabolites and suggest that Sphagnum-derived acids and minor phenolics play different roles in this interaction. This work provides new insight into the ecological role of Sphagnum phenolics by proposing a strong association with mycorrhizal colonization of shrubs.},

@article{Chokkathukalam.2013,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION
Stable isotope-labelling experiments have recently gained increasing popularity in metabolomics studies, providing unique insights into the dynamics of metabolic fluxes, beyond the steady-state information gathered by routine mass spectrometry. However, most liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data analysis software lacks features that enable automated annotation and relative quantification of labelled metabolite peaks. Here, we describe mzMatch-ISO, a new extension to the metabolomics analysis pipeline mzMatch.R.
RESULTS
Targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using mzMatch-ISO provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity of labelling for every metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots that show (i) the chromatograms of the isotope peaks of each compound in each sample group; (ii) the ratio of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling; (iii) the average peak area of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample group; and (iv) the trend in the relative amount of labelling in a predetermined isotopomer. To aid further statistical analyses, the values used for generating these plots are also provided as a tab-delimited file. We demonstrate the power and versatility of mzMatch-ISO by analysing a (13)C-labelled metabolome dataset from trypanosomal parasites.
AVAILABILITY
mzMatch.R and mzMatch-ISO are available free of charge from http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net and can be used on Linux and Windows platforms running the latest version of R.

@article{Colquhoun.2017,
 abstract = {We wish to answer this question: If you observe a 'significant' p-value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by p-values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3 : 1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p-value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5{\%}, you would have to assume that you were 87{\%} sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p = 0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100 : 1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8{\%} if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5{\%} you would need to observe p = 0.00045. It is recommended that the terms 'significant' and 'non-significant' should never be used. Rather, p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5{\%}) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p-value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p < 0.05 as 'statistically significant'. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomization and p-hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.},

@article{Delavaux.2019,
 abstract = {Island biogeography has traditionally focused primarily on abiotic drivers of colonization, extinction and speciation. However, establishment on islands could also be limited by biotic drivers, such as the absence of symbionts. Most plants, for example, form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi, whose limited dispersal to islands could act as a colonization filter for plants. We tested this hypothesis using global-scale analyses of {\~{}}1.4 million plant occurrences, including {\~{}}200,000 plant species across {\~{}}1,100 regions. We find evidence for a mycorrhizal filter (that is, the filtering out of mycorrhizal plants on islands), with mycorrhizal associations less common among native island plants than native mainland plants. Furthermore, the proportion of native mycorrhizal plants in island floras decreased with isolation, possibly as a consequence of a decline in symbiont establishment. We also show that mycorrhizal plants contribute disproportionately to the classic latitudinal gradient of plant species diversity, with the proportion of mycorrhizal plants being highest near the equator and decreasing towards the poles. Anthropogenic pressure and land use alter these plant biogeographical patterns. Naturalized floras show a greater proportion of mycorrhizal plant species on islands than in mainland regions, as expected from the anthropogenic co-introduction of plants with their symbionts to islands and anthropogenic disturbance of symbionts in mainland regions. We identify the mycorrhizal association as an overlooked driver of global plant biogeographical patterns with implications for contemporary island biogeography and our understanding of plant invasions.},

@article{DOrangeville.2018,
 abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors-the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)-are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and ψ50 ) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

 abstract = {Raman and Fourier transform IR (FTIR) microspectroscopic images of biological material (tissue sections) contain detailed information about their chemical composition. The challenge lies in identifying changes in chemical composition, as well as locating and assigning these changes to different conditions (pathology, anatomy, environmental or genetic factors). Multivariate data analysis techniques are ideal for decrypting such information from the data. This protocol provides a user-friendly pipeline and graphical user interface (GUI) for data pre-processing and unmixing of pixel spectra into their contributing pure components by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) analysis. The analysis considers the full spectral profile in order to identify the chemical compounds and to visualize their distribution across the sample to categorize chemically distinct areas. Results are rapidly achieved (usually <30-60 min per image), and they are easy to interpret and evaluate both in terms of chemistry and biology, making the method generally more powerful than principal component analysis (PCA) or heat maps of single-band intensities. In addition, chemical and biological evaluation of the results by means of reference matching and segmentation maps (based on k-means clustering) is possible.},

@article{Ferrazza.2017,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION
Labelling experiments in biology usually make use of isotopically enriched substrates, with the two most commonly employed isotopes for metabolism being 2H and 13C. At the end of the experiment some metabolites will have incorporated the labelling isotope, to a degree that depends on the metabolic turnover. In order to propose a meaningful biological interpretation, it is necessary to estimate the amount of labelling, and one possible route is to exploit the fact that MS isotopic patterns reflect the isotopic distributions.
RESULTS
We developed the IsotopicLabelling R package, a tool able to extract and analyze isotopic patterns from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) data relative to labelling experiments. This package estimates the isotopic abundance of the employed stable isotope (either 2H or 13C) within a specified list of analytes.

@article{Fisher.2018,
 abstract = {Full-subsets information theoretic approaches are becoming an increasingly popular tool for exploring predictive power and variable importance where a wide range of candidate predictors are being considered. Here, we describe a simple function in the statistical programming language R that can be used to construct, fit, and compare a complete model set of possible ecological or environmental predictors, given a response variable of interest and a starting generalized additive (mixed) model fit. Main advantages include not requiring a complete model to be fit as the starting point for candidate model set construction (meaning that a greater number of predictors can potentially be explored than might be available through functions such as dredge); model sets that include interactions between factors and continuous nonlinear predictors; and automatic removal of models with correlated predictors (based on a user defined criterion for exclusion). The function takes continuous predictors, which are fitted using smoothers via either gam, gamm (mgcv) or gamm4, as well as factor variables which are included on their own or as two-level interaction terms within the gam smooth (via use of the {\textquotedbl}by{\textquotedbl} argument), or with themselves. The function allows any model to be constructed and used as a null model, and takes a range of arguments that allow control over the model set being constructed, including specifying cyclic and linear continuous predictors, specification of the smoothing algorithm used, and the maximum complexity allowed for smooth terms. The use of the function is demonstrated via case studies that highlight how appropriate model sets can be easily constructed and the broader utility of the approach for exploratory ecology.},

@article{Freeman.2012,
 abstract = {Terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems contribute almost equally to the sequestration of ca 50 per cent of anthropogenic CO(2) emissions, and already play a role in minimizing our impact on Earth's climate. On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2-3{\%} of the Earth's landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an 'enzymic latch' on decomposition. Here, we propose to harness that mechanism in a series of peatland geoengineering strategies whereby molecular, biogeochemical, agronomical and afforestation approaches increase carbon capture and long-term sequestration in peat-forming terrestrial ecosystems.},

@article{Gao.2019,
 abstract = {Peatlands are a major source of atmospheric CH4. The availability of terminal electron acceptors largely affects the ratio of CO2 to CH4 formation under water-logged anoxic conditions in these systems. Although the importance of peat organic matter as an electron acceptor is increasingly recognized, the actual budgets of electron accepting capacities of dissolved and particulate organic matter remain poorly characterized. To address this research need, we incubated three different peat materials and linked changes in the electron accepting capacities (EAC) of peat organic matter (OM), including dissolved and particulate organic matter, to the observed CO2 and CH4 formation. Under anaerobic conditions, EACOM decreased inverse to non-methanogenic CO2 formation. Only after utilizable EACOM was depleted did strictly methanogenic conditions evolve with equimolar CH4 and CO2 formation rates, as theoretically expected. The reduction of OM and the resultant decrease in EACOM explained between 26 and 56{\%} of the non-methanogenic CO2, which was between 5 and 39{\%} of total CO2 produced. Compared to EACPOM, EACDOM remained constant and may have served as a mediator in electron transfer to the POM. In summary, our study quantitatively demonstrated the important role of peat OM as terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration in organic soils.},

 abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. <p /> In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.},

Effects of wildfire on permafrost peatlands last for 30 years and include a warmer and deeper active layer, and spatial expansion of continuously thawed soil layers (taliks). These impacts on the soil thermal regime are associated with a tripled rate of thermokarst bog expansion along permafrost edges. Our results suggest that wildfire is directly responsible for 2200 ± 1500 km2 (95{\%} CI) of thermokarst bog development in the study region over the last 30 years, representing {\~{}}25{\%} of all thermokarst bog expansion during this period. With increasing fire frequency under a warming climate, this study emphasizes the need to consider wildfires when projecting future circumpolar permafrost thaw.},

@article{Givelet.2004,
 abstract = {For detailed reconstructions of atmospheric metal deposition using peat cores from bogs, a comprehensive protocol for working with peat cores is proposed. The first step is to locate and determine suitable sampling sites in accordance with the principal goal of the study, the period of time of interest and the precision required. Using the state of the art procedures and field equipment, peat cores are collected in such a way as to provide high quality records for paleoenvironmental study. Pertinent field observations gathered during the fieldwork are recorded in a field report. Cores are kept frozen at -18 degree C until they can be prepared in the laboratory. Frozen peat cores are precisely cut into 1 cm slices using a stainless steel band saw with stainless steel blades. The outside edges of each slice are removed using a titanium knife to avoid any possible contamination which might have occurred during the sampling and handling stage. Each slice is split, with one-half kept frozen for future studies (archived), and the other half further subdivided for physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses. Physical parameters such as ash and water contents, the bulk density and the degree of decomposition of the peat are determined using established methods. A subsample is dried overnight at 105 degree C in a drying oven and milled in a centrifugal mill with titanium sieve. Prior to any expensive and time consuming chemical procedures and analyses, the resulting powdered samples, after manual homogenisation, are measured for more than twenty-two major and trace elements using non-destructive X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) methods. This approach provides lots of valuable geochemical data which documents the natural geochemical processes which occur in the peat profiles and their possible effect on the trace metal profiles. The development, evaluation and use of peat cores from bogs as archives of high-resolution records of atmospheric deposition of mineral dust and trace elements have led to the development of many analytical procedures which now permit the measurement of a wide range of elements in peat samples such as lead and lead isotope ratios, mercury, arsenic, antimony, silver, molybdenum, thorium, uranium, rare earth elements. Radiometric methods (the carbon bomb pulse of (14)C, (210)Pb and conventional (14)C dating) are combined to allow reliable age-depth models to be reconstructed for each peat profile.},

@article{Gorham.1991,
 abstract = {Boreal and subarctic peatlands comprise a carbon pool of 455 Pg that has accumulated during the postglacial period at an average net rate of 0.096 Pg/yr (1 Pg = 1015 g). Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr. Longterm drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with conbustion of fuel peat adding °0.026 Pg/yr. Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release ° 0.046 Pg of carbon annually. Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands. The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming. The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention. Finally, satellite-monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.},

This dataset was produced in 2017 by CRU at the University of East Anglia and extends the CRU CY4.00 data to include 2016. CRU CY4.01 is a full release, differing only in methodology from the existing current version 3 release, v3.25. Both are released concurrently to support comparative evaluations between these two versions, however, this will be the last release of version 3.
Spatial averages are calculated using area-weighted means. CRU CY4.01 is derived directly from the CRU TS4.01 dataset. CRU CY version 4.01 spans the period 1901-2016 for 289 countries.
To understand the CRU CY4.01 dataset, it is important to understand the construction and limitations of the underlying dataset, CRU TS4.01. It is therefore recommended that all users read the Harris et al, 2014 paper and the CRU TS4.01 release notes listed in the online documentation on this record.

 abstract = {Microbially mediated terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) to a large extent control the fate of redox reactive elements and associated reactions in anoxic soils, sediments, and aquifers. This review focuses on thermodynamic controls and regulation of H2-dependent TEAPs, case studies illustrating this concept, and the quantitative description of thermodynamic controls in modeling. Other electron transfer processes are considered where appropriate. The work reviewed shows that thermodynamics and microbial kinetics are connected near thermodynamic equilibrium. Free energy thresholds for terminal respiration are physiologically based and often near -20 kJ mol(-1), depending on the mechanism of ATP generation; more positive free energy values have been reported under {\textquotedbl}starvation conditions{\textquotedbl} for methanogenesis and lower values for TEAPs that provide more energy. H2-dependent methanogenesis and sulfate reduction are under direct thermodynamic control in soils and sediments and generally approach theoretical minimum energy thresholds. If H2 concentrations are lowered by thermodynamically more potent TEAPs, these processes are inhibited. This principle is also valid for TEAPS providing more free energy, such as denitrification and arsenate reduction, but electron donor concentration cannot be lowered so that the processes reach theoretical energy thresholds. Thermodynamics and kinetics have been integrated by combining traditional descriptions of microbial kinetics with the equilibrium constant K and reaction quotient Q of a process, taking into account process-specific threshold energies. This approach is dynamically evolving toward a general concept of microbially driven electron transfer in anoxic environments and has been used successfully in applications ranging from bioreactor regulation to groundwater and sediment biogeochemistry.},

Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.},

 abstract = {In bioenergetic systems quinones play a central part in the coupling of electron and proton transfer. The specific function of each quinone binding site is based on the protein-quinone interaction that can be described by means of reaction induced FTIR difference spectroscopy, induced for example by light or electrochemically. The identification of sites in enzymes from the respiratory chain is presented together with the analysis of the accommodation of different types of quinones to the same enzyme and the possibility to monitor the interaction with inhibitors. Reaction induced FTIR difference spectroscopy is shown to give an essential information on the general geometry of quinone binding sites, the conformation of the ring and of the substituents as well as essential structural information on the identity of the amino-acid residues lining this site.

 abstract = {Peatlands represent large terrestrial carbon banks. Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions, where low temperatures and water saturation preserve organic matter, the existence of peat in (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we examined peat and plant chemistry across a latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics. Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate and greater aromatic content than near-surface high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite warm temperatures. Because we observed similar declines in carbohydrate content with depth in high-latitude peat, our data explain recent field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite temperature increases up to 9 °C. We suggest that high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized in the face of climate change by their ultimately lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition, similar to tropical peats.},

@article{Huang.2014,
 abstract = {Studies of isotopically labeled compounds have been fundamental to understanding metabolic pathways and fluxes. They have traditionally, however, been used in conjunction with targeted analyses that identify and quantify a limited number of labeled downstream metabolites. Here we describe an alternative workflow that leverages recent advances in untargeted metabolomic technologies to track the fates of isotopically labeled metabolites in a global, unbiased manner. This untargeted approach can be applied to discover novel biochemical pathways and characterize changes in the fates of labeled metabolites as a function of altered biological conditions such as disease. To facilitate the data analysis, we introduce X(13)CMS, an extension of the widely used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic software package XCMS. X(13)CMS uses the XCMS platform to detect metabolite peaks and perform retention-time alignment in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data. With the use of the XCMS output, the program then identifies isotopologue groups that correspond to isotopically labeled compounds. The retrieval of these groups is done without any a priori knowledge besides the following input parameters: (i) the mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes, (ii) the mass accuracy of the instrument used in the analysis, and (iii) the estimated retention-time reproducibility of the chromatographic method. Despite its name, X(13)CMS can be used to track any isotopic label. Additionally, it detects differential labeling patterns in biological samples collected from parallel control and experimental conditions. We validated the ability of X(13)CMS to accurately retrieve labeled metabolites from complex biological matrices both with targeted LC/MS/MS analysis of a subset of the hits identified by the program and with labeled standards spiked into cell extracts. We demonstrate the full functionality of X(13)CMS with an analysis of cultured rat astrocytes treated with uniformly labeled (U-)(13)C-glucose during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Our results show that out of 223 isotopologue groups enriched from U-(13)C-glucose, 95 have statistically significant differential labeling patterns in astrocytes challenged with LPS compared to unchallenged control cells. Only two of these groups overlap with the 32 differentially regulated peaks identified by XCMS, indicating that X(13)CMS uncovers different and complementary information from untargeted metabolomic studies. Like XCMS, X(13)CMS is implemented in R. It is available from our laboratory website at http://pattilab.wustl.edu/x13cms.php .},

This study explores the relationship between peatland drying and carbon cycling on centennial timescales in central China using lipid biomarkers. The difference between peat n-alkane δ2H and a nearby stalagmite δ18O record reveals that intervals of prominent peatland drying occurred during the mid-Holocene. Synchronous with these drier conditions, leaf wax δ13C values show large~negative excursions, with the utilization of CO2 respired from the peatland subsurface for plant photosynthesis being a possible mechanism. Crucially, successive drying events appear to have had a cumulative impact on the susceptibility of peat carbon stores to climate change. Concurrently, bacterially derived hopane δ13C values suggest the occurrence of enhanced methane oxidation during the drier periods. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how respiration and degradation of peat are enhanced during drying events.},

@article{Jassey.2011,
 abstract = {Microbial communities living in Sphagnum are known to constitute early indicators of ecosystem disturbances, but little is known about their response (including their trophic relationships) to climate change. A microcosm experiment was designed to test the effects of a temperature gradient (15, 20, and 25°C) on microbial communities including different trophic groups (primary producers, decomposers, and unicellular predators) in Sphagnum segments (0-3 cm and 3-6 cm of the capitulum). Relationships between microbial communities and abiotic factors (pH, conductivity, temperature, and polyphenols) were also studied. The density and the biomass of testate amoebae in Sphagnum upper segments increased and their community structure changed in heated treatments. The biomass of testate amoebae was linked to the biomass of bacteria and to the total biomass of other groups added and, thus, suggests that indirect effects on the food web structure occurred. Redundancy analysis revealed that microbial assemblages differed strongly in Sphagnum upper segments along a temperature gradient in relation to abiotic factors. The sensitivity of these assemblages made them interesting indicators of climate change. Phenolic compounds represented an important explicative factor in microbial assemblages and outlined the potential direct and (or) indirect effects of phenolics on microbial communities.},

@article{Jonard.2018,
 abstract = {Organic soils play a key role in global warming because they store large amount of soil carbon which might be degraded with changing soil temperatures or soil water contents. There is thus a strong need to monitor these soils and, in particular, their hydrological characteristics using, for instance, space-borne L-band brightness temperature observations. However, there are still open issues with respect to soil moisture retrieval techniques over organic soils. In view of this, organic soil blocks with their vegetation cover were collected from a heathland in the Skjern River catchment in western Denmark and then transported to a remote sensing field laboratory in Germany where their structure was reconstituted. The controlled conditions at this field laboratory made it possible to perform tower-based L-band radiometer measurements of the soils over a period of two months. Brightness temperature data were inverted using a radiative transfer (RT) model for estimating the time variations in the soil dielectric permittivity and the vegetation optical depth. In addition, the effective vegetation scattering albedo parameter of the RT model was retrieved based on a two-step inversion approach. The remote estimations of the dielectric permittivity were compared to in situ measurements. The results indicated that the radiometer-derived dielectric permittivities were significantly correlated with the in situ measurements, but their values were systematically lower compared to the in situ ones. This could be explained by the difference between the operating frequency of the L-band radiometer (1.4 GHz) and that of the in situ sensors (70 MHz). The effective vegetation scattering albedo parameter was found to be polarization dependent. While the scattering effect within the vegetation could be neglected at horizontal polarization, it was found to be important at vertical polarization. The vegetation optical depth estimated values over time oscillated between 0.10 and 0.19 with a mean value of 0.13. This study provides further insights into the characterization of the L-band brightness temperature signatures of organic soil surface layers and, in particular, into the parametrization of the RT model for these specific soils. Therefore, the results of this study are expected to improve the performance of space-borne remote sensing soil moisture products over areas dominated by organic soils.},

 abstract = {Peatlands play a fundamental role in climate regulation through their long-term accumulation of atmospheric carbon. Despite their resilience, peatlands are vulnerable to climate change. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to better understand these ecosystems at large spatial scales through time. In this study, we estimated water table depth from a 6-year time sequence of airborne shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imagery. We found that the narrowband index NDWI1240 is a strong predictor of water table position. However, we illustrate the importance of considering peatland anisotropy on SWIR imagery from the summer months when the vascular plants are in full foliage, as not all illumination conditions are suitable for retrieving water table position. We also model net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 10 years of Landsat TM5 imagery and from 4 years of Landsat OLI 8 imagery. Our results show the transferability of the model between imagery from sensors with similar spectral and radiometric properties such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. NEE modeled from airborne hyperspectral imagery more closely correlated to eddy covariance tower measurements than did models based on satellite images. With fine spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions, new generation satellite imagery and airborne hyperspectral imagery allow for monitoring the response of peatlands to both allogenic and autogenic factors.},

 abstract = {Potential changes in both the intensity and frequency of extreme drought events are vital aspects of regional climate change that can alter the distribution and dynamics of water availability and subsequently affect carbon cycles at the ecosystem level. The effects of extreme drought events on the carbon budget of peatland in the Zoige plateau and its response mechanisms were studied using an in-field controlled experimental method. The results indicated that the peatland ecosystem of the Zoige plateau functioned as a carbon sink while under the control (CK) or extreme drought (D) treatment throughout the entire growing season. Maximum fluxes of methane (CH4) emissions and the weakest carbon sink activity from this ecosystem were in the early growth stage, the most powerful carbon sink activity was during the peak growth stage, while the absorption sink activity of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 was present during the senescence stage. Extreme drought reduced the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) of the peatland ecosystem by 14.5{\%} and 12.6{\%}, respectively (p < 0.05) and the net ability to store carbon was reduced by 11.3{\%}. Overall, the GPP was highly sensitive to extreme drought. Moreover, extreme drought significantly reduced the CH4 fluxes of the ecosystem and even changed the peatland from a CH4 emission source to a CH4 sink. Subsequent to drought treatment, extreme drought was also shown to have a carry-over effect on the carbon budget of this ecosystem. Soil water content and soil temperature were the main driving factors of carbon budget change in the peatland of the Zoige plateau, but with the increase in soil depth, these driving forces were decreased. The findings indicated that frequent extreme drought events in the future might reduce the net carbon sink function of peatland areas, with an especially strong influence on CO2.},

 abstract = {Peatlands store 1/3 of global soil carbon, destabilisation of which contributes much to the recent increase in DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in freshwater ecosystems. One suggested mechanism for the enhanced decomposition of peat and the releases of DOC is recovery from acidification. However, no biological role in the process has yet been identified. Here we report extracellular enzyme activities and microbial composition in peatlands of Korea, the UK, Japan and Indonesia, and find higher pH to promote phenol oxidase activities, greater abundances in Actinobacteria and fungi, and enhanced pore-water DOC concentrations. Our pH manipulation experiments also showed that increase in pH enhanced phenol oxidase activity and DOC production with greater Actinobacterial and fungal abundances. Finally, knockout or addition of phenol oxidase dramatically changed DOC and phenolic production, indicating the central role of phenol oxidase in DOC mobilisation. Our findings provide evidence to support a previously unrecognized biological mechanism through which pH increases activate phenol oxidase, accelerating the release of DOC and phenolics.},

@article{Klotzbucher.2011,
 abstract = {Lignin is a main component of plant litter. Its degradation is thought to be critical for litter decomposition rates and the build-up of soil organic matter. We studied the relationships between lignin degradation and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and of CO2 during litter decomposition. Needle or leaf litter of five species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, mountain ash, European beech, sycamore maple) and of different decomposition stage (freshly fallen and up to 27 months of field exposure) was incubated in the laboratory for two years. Lignin degradation was followed with the CuO method. Strong lignin degradation occurred during the first 200 incubation days, as revealed by decreasing yields of lignin-derived phenols. Thereafter lignin degradation leveled off. This pattern was similar for fresh and decomposed litter, and it stands in contrast to the common view of limited lignin degradation in fresh litter. Dissolved organic carbon and CO2 also peaked in the first period of the incubation but were not interrelated. In the later phase of incubation, CO2 production was positively correlated with DOC amounts, suggesting that bioavailable, soluble compounds became a limiting factor for CO2 production. Lignin degradation occurred only when CO2 production was high, and not limited by bioavailable carbon. Thus carbon availability was the most important control on lignin degradation. In turn, lignin degradation could not explain differences in DOC and CO2 production over the study period. Our results challenge the traditional view regarding the fate and role of lignin during litter decomposition. Lignin degradation is controlled by the availability of easily decomposable carbon sources. Consequently, it occurs particularly in the initial phase of litter decomposition and is hampered at later stages if easily decomposable resources decline.},

@article{Kremer.2004,
 abstract = {Spiral secondary walls are found in hyaline cells of Sphagnum, in the elaters of most liverworts, and in elaters of the hornwort Megaceros. Recent studies on these cells suggest that cytoskeletal and ultrastructural processes involved in cell differentiation and secondary wall formation are similar in bryophytes and vascular plant tracheary elements. To examine differences in wall structure, primary and secondary wall constituents of the hyaline cells of Sphagnum novo-zelandicum and elaters of the liverwort Radula buccinifera and the hornwort Megaceros gracilis were analyzed by immunohistochemical and chemical methods. Anti-arabinogalactan-protein antibodies, JIM8 and JIM13, labeled the central fibrillar secondary wall layer of Megaceros elaters and the walls of Sphagnum leaf cells, but did not label the walls of Radula elaters. The CCRC-M7 antibody, which detects an arabinosylated (1-->6)-linked beta-galactan epitope, exclusively labeled hyaline cells in Sphagnum leaves and the secondary walls of Radula elaters. Anti-pectin antibodies, LM5 and JIM5, labeled the primary wall in Megaceros elaters. LM5 also labeled the central layer of the secondary wall but only during formation. In Radula elaters, JIM5 and another anti-pectin antibody, JIM7, labeled the primary wall. The distribution of arabinogalactan-proteins and pectic polysaccharides restricted to specific wall types and stages of development provides evidence for the developmental and functional regulation of cell wall composition in bryophytes. Monosaccharide-linkage analysis of Sphagnum leaf cell walls suggests they contain polysaccharides similar to those of higher plants. The most abundant linkage was 4-Glc, typical of cellulose, but there was also evidence for xyloglucans, 4-linked mannans, 4-linked xylans and rhamnogalacturonan-type polysaccharides.},

To investigate hydrogen bond formation in lignin, an abundant natural polymer found in plants, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of various lignin model compounds was performed. Four monomeric model compounds and one dimeric model compound were studied under various conditions. FTIR analysis revealed aliphatic hydroxyl groups form stronger hydrogen bonds than phenolic hydroxyl groups. Further, the dimeric biphenyl-type structure formed significantly stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds as compared to the other monomeric model compounds. Results from the model compound studies were used to explain the observed complex hydrogen-bonding system present in both softwood and hardwood technical lignins. Together with chemical analysis, we discuss the difference in hydrogen bonding between hardwood and softwood lignin and the observed differences in the glass transition temperature.},

 abstract = {Peatlands in northern latitudes sequester one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Mineral dusts can affect the primary productivity of terrestrial systems through nutrient transport but this process has not yet been documented in these peat-rich regions. Here we analysed organic and inorganic fractions of an 8900-year-old sequence from Store Mosse (the {\textquotedbl}Great Bog{\textquotedbl}) in southern Sweden. Between 5420 and 4550 cal yr BP, we observe a seven-fold increase in net peat-accumulation rates corresponding to a maximum carbon-burial rate of 150 g C m-2 yr-1 - more than six times the global average. This high peat accumulation event occurs in parallel with a distinct change in the character of the dust deposited on the bog, which moves from being dominated by clay minerals to less weathered, phosphate and feldspar minerals. We hypothesize that this shift boosted nutrient input to the bog and stimulated ecosystem productivity. This study shows that diffuse sources and dust dynamics in northern temperate latitudes, often overlooked by the dust community in favour of arid and semi-arid regions, can be important drivers of peatland carbon accumulation and by extension, global climate, warranting further consideration in predictions of future climate variability.},

 abstract = {SUMMARY
Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set.

 abstract = {Arctic tundra ecosystems have experienced unprecedented change associated with climate warming over recent decades. Across the Pan-Arctic, vegetation productivity and surface greenness have trended positively over the period of satellite observation. However, since 2011 these trends have slowed considerably, showing signs of browning in many regions. It is unclear what factors are driving this change and which regions/landforms will be most sensitive to future browning. Here we provide evidence linking decadal patterns in arctic greening and browning with regional climate change and local permafrost-driven landscape heterogeneity. We analyzed the spatial variability of decadal-scale trends in surface greenness across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska ({\~{}}60,000 km²) using the Landsat archive (1999-2014), in combination with novel 30 m classifications of polygonal tundra and regional watersheds, finding landscape heterogeneity and regional climate change to be the most important factors controlling historical greenness trends. Browning was linked to increased temperature and precipitation, with the exception of young landforms (developed following lake drainage), which will likely continue to green. Spatiotemporal model forecasting suggests carbon uptake potential to be reduced in response to warmer and/or wetter climatic conditions, potentially increasing the net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, at a greater degree than previously expected.},

 abstract = {The last two decades have seen tremendous progress in the application of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) as a versatile analysis method for data series obtained using a large variety of different spectroscopic modalities, including infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The analysis technique is applicable to a series of spectra recorded under the influence of an external sample perturbation. Two-dimensional COS analysis is not only helpful to decipher correlations, which may exist between distinct spectral features, but can also be utilized to obtain the sequence of individual spectral changes. The focus of this review article is on the application of 2D-COS for analyzing spatially resolved data with special emphasis on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) study. In this review, we briefly introduce the fundamentals of the generalized 2D-COS analysis approach, discuss specific points of 2D-COS application to spatially resolved spectra and demonstrate essential aspects of data pre-processing for 2D-COS analysis of spatially resolved spectra. Based on illustrative examples, we show that 2D-COS is useful for spectral band assignment in HSI applications and demonstrate its utility for detecting subtle correlations between spectra features, or between features from different imaging modalities in the case of heterospectral (multimodal) HSI. Furthermore, a short overview on existing 2D-COS software tools is provided. It is hoped that this article represents not only a useful guideline for 2D-COS analyses of spatially resolved hyperspectral data but supports also further dissemination of the 2D-COS analysis method as a whole.},

 abstract = {The transit of organic matter (OM) through the aquatic compartment of its global cycle has been intensively studied, traditionally with a focus on the processing and degradation of its dissolved fraction (dissolved organic matter, DOM). Because this is so intimately related to oxidation, the notion tenaciously persists that where oxygen is absent, DOM turnover is markedly slowed. In this Opinion Piece, we outline how diverse processes shape, transform and degrade DOM also in anoxic aquatic environments, and we focus here on inland waters as a particular case study. A suite of biogeochemical DOM functions that have received comparatively little attention may only be expressed in anoxic conditions and may result in enhanced biogeochemical roles of these deoxygenated habitats on a network scale.},

@article{Li.2020,
 abstract = {As one of the most abundant polymers in biosphere, lignin has attracted extensive attention as a kind of promising feedstock for biofuel and bio-based products. However, the utilization of lignin presents various challenges in that its complex composition and structure and high resistance to degradation. Lignin conversion through biological platform harnesses the catalytic power of microorganisms to decompose complex lignin molecules and obtain value-added products through biosynthesis. Given the heterogeneity of lignin, various microbial metabolic pathways are involved in lignin bioconversion processes, which has been characterized in extensive research work. With different types of lignin substrates (e.g., model compounds, technical lignin, and lignocellulosic biomass), several bacterial and fungal species have been proved to own lignin-degrading abilities and accumulate microbial products (e.g., lipid and polyhydroxyalkanoates), while the lignin conversion efficiencies are still relatively low. Genetic and metabolic strategies have been developed to enhance lignin biodegradation by reprogramming microbial metabolism, and diverse products, such as vanillin and dicarboxylic acids were also produced from lignin. This article aims at presenting a comprehensive review on lignin bioconversion including lignin degradation mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and applications for the production of value-added bioproducts. Advanced techniques on genetic and metabolic engineering are also covered in the recent development of biological platforms for lignin utilization. To conclude this article, the existing challenges for efficient lignin bioprocessing are analyzed and possible directions for future work are proposed.},

@article{Limpens.2003,
 abstract = {We tested the relationship between Sphagnum growth and the amount of nitrogen stored in free amino acids in a fertilisation experiment with intact peat monoliths in an open greenhouse in The Netherlands. Three nitrogen deposition scenarios were used: no nitrogen deposition, field conditions and a doubling of the latter, corresponding to 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1 )year(-1). Growth of Sphagnum as expressed by height increment was reduced in the 80 kg N treatment, but showed no correlation with the total nitrogen tissue concentration or with the concentration of individual or pooled free amino acids. The amount of nitrogen stored in free amino acids increased concomitantly with deposition, although it lagged more and more behind the total nitrogen concentration, the latter pointing to the accumulation of unmeasured nitrogen compounds. Asparagine clearly acted as the major storage compound for nitrogen in Sphagnum stem tissue, whereas arginine fulfilled this function to a lesser extent in the capitulum. It appears that nitrogen-induced growth inhibition of Sphagnum is related to acclimation rather than to certain threshold concentrations of amino nitrogen or total nitrogen. We propose that when Sphagnum is exposed to a step increase of nitrogen, its nitrogen metabolism does not adapt fast enough to keep up with the enhanced uptake rate. This imbalance between nitrogen uptake and assimilation may lead to an accumulation of toxic NH(4)(+ )in the cell and a subsequent reduction in growth.},

@article{Limpens.2011,
 abstract = {Peatlands in the northern hemisphere have accumulated more atmospheric carbon (C) during the Holocene than any other terrestrial ecosystem, making peatlands long-term C sinks of global importance. Projected increases in nitrogen (N) deposition and temperature make future accumulation rates uncertain. Here, we assessed the impact of N deposition on peatland C sequestration potential by investigating the effects of experimental N addition on Sphagnum moss. We employed meta-regressions to the results of 107 field experiments, accounting for sampling dependence in the data. We found that high N loading (comprising N application rate, experiment duration, background N deposition) depressed Sphagnum production relative to untreated controls. The interactive effects of presence of competitive vascular plants and high tissue N concentrations indicated intensified biotic interactions and altered nutrient stochiometry as mechanisms underlying the detrimental N effects. Importantly, a higher summer temperature (mean for July) and increased annual precipitation intensified the negative effects of N. The temperature effect was comparable to an experimental application of almost 4 g N m(-2)  yr(-1) for each 1°C increase. Our results indicate that current rates of N deposition in a warmer environment will strongly inhibit C sequestration by Sphagnum-dominated vegetation.},

 abstract = {A fast and memory-efficient calculation of theoretical isotope patterns is crucial for the routine interpretation of mass spectrometric data. For high-resolution experiments, calculations must procure the exact masses and probabilities of relevant isotopologues over a wide range of polyisotopic compounds, while pruning low-probable ones. Here, a novel albeit simple treelike structure is introduced to swiftly derive sets of relevant subisotopologues for each element in a molecule, which are then combined to the isotopologues of the full molecule. In contrast to existing approaches, transitions via single replacements of the most abundant isotope per element are used in separable tree branches to derive subisotopologues from each other. Moreover, the underlying transition trees prevent redundant replacements and permit the detection of the most probable isotopologue in a first phase. A relative threshold can then be exploited in a second parallelized phase for a precise prepruning of large fractions of the remaining subisotopologues.

 abstract = {Bryophytes are the second largest taxonomic group in the plant kingdom; yet, studies conducted to better understand their chemical composition are rare. The aim of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of bryophytes common in Northern Europe by using elemental, spectral, and non-destructive analytical methods, such as Fourier transform IR spectrometry (FT-IR), solid-phase (13) C-NMR spectrometry, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), for the purpose of investigating their chemotaxonomic relationships on the basis of chemical-composition data. The results of all these analyses showed that bryophytes consist mainly of carbohydrates. Judging by FT-IR spectra, the OH groups in combination of CO groups were the most abundant groups. The (13) C-NMR spectra provided information on the presence of such compounds as phenolics and lipids. It was found that the amount of phenolic compounds in bryophytes is relatively small. This finding definitely confirmed the absence of lignin in the studied bryophytes. Cluster analysis was used to better understand differences in the chemical composition of bryophyte samples and to evaluate possible usage of these methods in the chemotaxonomy of bryophytes.},

 abstract = {Long-term additions of nitrogen (N) to peatlands have altered bryophyte growth, species dominance, N content in peat and peat water, and often resulted in enhanced Sphagnum decomposition rate. However, these results have mainly been derived from experiments in which N was applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), neglecting the fact that in polluted areas, wet deposition may be dominated either by NO3(-) or NH4(+). We studied effects of elevated wet deposition of NO3(-) vs. NH4(+) alone (8 or 56kgNha(-1)yr(-1) over and above the background of 8kgNha(-1)yr(-1) for 5 to 11years) or combined with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on Sphagnum quality for decomposers, mass loss, and associated changes in hummock pore water in an ombrotrophic bog (Whim). Adding N, especially as NH4(+), increased N concentration in Sphagnum, but did not enhance mass loss from Sphagnum. Mass loss seemed to depend mainly on moss species and climatic factors. Only high applications of N affected hummock pore water chemistry, which varied considerably over time. Overall, C and N cycling in this N treated bog appeared to be decoupled. We conclude that moss species, seasonal and annual variation in climatic factors, direct negative effects of N (NH4(+) toxicity) on Sphagnum production, and indirect effects (increase in pH and changes in plant species dominance under elevated NO3(-) alone and with PK) drive Sphagnum decomposition and hummock C and N dynamics at Whim.},

@article{Mecozzi.2009b,
 abstract = {In this paper the marine organic matter soluble in an alkaline medium called extractable humic substance (EHS), was extracted from three sediment samples of Tyrrhenian Sea and separated by precipitation at pH 2 in the two fractions of fulvic acids (FAs) and humic acids (HAs). FAs were further fractionated in seven sub-samples of different molecular weight (mw) by means of seven different ultrafiltration membranes operating in the range between mw<1 kDa and mw>100 kDa. Then the qualitative composition of each sample of fractionated FAs and HAs was studied by means of one-dimensional Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in reflectance mode (FTIR-DRIFT) and by two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy both in wavelength-wavelength (WW) and in sample-sample (SS) mode. The application of 2D correlation WW spectroscopy allows to elucidate the different roles played by carbohydrates and proteins with respect to some lipid compounds such as fatty acids and ester fatty acids during the process of aggregate formations from mw approximately 1 kDa to higher size aggregates. In addition, 2D correlation WW spectroscopy allows to observe some peculiar interactions between carbohydrates and proteins in the formation of EHS aggregates, interactions which vary from a sample to another sample. The results of 2D correlation SS spectroscopy confirm the general evidences obtained by 2D WW spectroscopy and moreover, they also describe the formation of EHS aggregates as a complex process where evolutionary links and connectivity between aggregates of neighbour molecular size ranges are not evident. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy applied to FTIR spectroscopy shows to be a powerful tool for the investigation of the mechanisms involved in EHS aggregation because it supports the acquisition of structural information which sometimes can be hardly obtained by one-dimensional FTIR spectroscopy.},

@article{Miller.2016,
 abstract = {Technology and collaboration enable dramatic increases in the size of psychological and psychiatric data collections, but finding structure in these large data sets with many collected variables is challenging. Decision tree ensembles such as random forests (Strobl, Malley, {\&} Tutz, 2009) are a useful tool for finding structure, but are difficult to interpret with multiple outcome variables which are often of interest in psychology. To find and interpret structure in data sets with multiple outcomes and many predictors (possibly exceeding the sample size), we introduce a multivariate extension to a decision tree ensemble method called gradient boosted regression trees (Friedman, 2001). Our extension, multivariate tree boosting, is a method for nonparametric regression that is useful for identifying important predictors, detecting predictors with nonlinear effects and interactions without specification of such effects, and for identifying predictors that cause 2 or more outcome variables to covary. We provide the R package {\textquotedbl}mvtboost{\textquotedbl} to estimate, tune, and interpret the resulting model, which extends the implementation of univariate boosting in the R package {\textquotedbl}gbm{\textquotedbl} (Ridgeway, 2015) to continuous, multivariate outcomes. To illustrate the approach, we analyze predictors of psychological well-being (Ryff {\&} Keyes, 1995). Simulations verify that our approach identifies predictors with nonlinear effects and achieves high prediction accuracy, exceeding or matching the performance of (penalized) multivariate multiple regression and multivariate decision trees over a wide range of conditions.

 abstract = {Improvements in Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) enable increasingly more complex experiments in the field of metabolomics. What is directly detected in FT-MS spectra are spectral features (peaks) that correspond to sets of adducted and charged forms of specific molecules in the sample. The robust assignment of these features is an essential step for MS-based metabolomics experiments, but the sheer complexity of what is detected and a variety of analytically introduced variance, errors, and artifacts has hindered the systematic analysis of complex patterns of observed peaks with respect to isotope content. We have developed a method called SMIRFE that detects small biomolecules and determines their elemental molecular formula (EMF) using detected sets of isotopologue peaks sharing the same EMF. SMIRFE does not use a database of known metabolite formulas; instead a nearly comprehensive search space of all isotopologues within a mass range is constructed and used for assignment. This search space can be tailored for different isotope labeling patterns expected in different stable isotope tracing experiments. Using consumer-level computing equipment, a large search space of 2000 Da was constructed, and assignment performance was evaluated and validated using verified assignments on a pair of peak lists derived from spectra containing unlabeled and 15N-labeled versions of amino acids derivatized using ethylchloroformate. SMIRFE identified 18 of 18 predicted derivatized EMFs, and each assignment was evaluated statistically and assigned an e-value representing the probability to occur by chance.},

@article{Noda.2017,
 abstract = {A tutorial is provided for the generalized two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS), which is applicable to the vibrational spectroscopic study of proteins and related systems. In 2DCOS, similarity or dissimilarity among variations of spectroscopic intensities, which are induced by applying an external perturbation to the sample, is examined by constructing correlation spectra defined by two independent spectral variable axes. By spreading congested or overlapped peaks along the second dimension, apparent spectral resolution is enhanced and interpretation of complex spectra becomes simplified. A set of simple rules for the intensities and signs of correlation peaks is used to extract insightful information. Simulated IR spectra for a model protein are used to demonstrate the specific utility of 2DCOS. Additional tools useful in the 2DCOS analysis of proteins, such as data segmentation assisted with moving-window analysis, 2D codistribution analysis, Pareto scaling, and null-space projection are also discussed.},

@article{Palace.2018,
 abstract = {Rising global temperatures tied to increases in greenhouse gas emissions are impacting high latitude regions, leading to changes in vegetation composition and feedbacks to climate through increased methane (CH4) emissions. In subarctic peatlands, permafrost collapse has led to shifts in vegetation species on landscape scales with high spatial heterogeneity. Our goal was to provide a baseline for vegetation distribution related to permafrost collapse and changes in biogeochemical processes. We collected unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery at Stordalen Mire, Abisko, Sweden to classify vegetation cover types. A series of digital image processing routines were used to generate texture attributes within the image for the purpose of characterizing vegetative cover types. An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to classify the image. The ANN used all texture variables and color bands (three spectral bands and six metrics) to generate a probability map for each of the eight cover classes. We used the highest probability for a class at each pixel to designate the cover type in the final map. Our overall misclassification rate was 32{\%}, while omission and commission error by class ranged from 0{\%} to 50{\%}. We found that within our area of interest, cover classes most indicative of underlying permafrost (hummock and tall shrub) comprised 43.9{\%} percent of the landscape. Our effort showed the capability of an ANN applied to UAS high-resolution imagery to develop a classification that focuses on vegetation types associated with permafrost status and therefore potentially changes in greenhouse gas exchange. We also used a method to examine the multiple probabilities representing cover class prediction at the pixel level to examine model confusion. UAS image collection can be inexpensive and a repeatable avenue to determine vegetation change at high latitudes, which can further be used to estimate and scale corresponding changes in CH4 emissions.},

 abstract = {The complex and indeterminant composition of NOM makes characterization of its redox properties challenging. Approaches that have been taken to address this challenge include chemical probe reactions, potentiometric titrations, chronocoulometry, and voltammetry. In this study, we revisit the use of direct voltammetric methods in aprotic solvents by applying an expanded and refined suite of methods to a large set of NOM samples and model compounds (54 NOM samples from 10 different sources, 7 NOM model compounds, and 2 fresh extracts of plant materials that are high in redox-active quinonoid model compounds dissolved in DMSO). Refinements in the methods of fitting the data obtained by staircase cyclic voltammetry (SCV) provided improved definition of peaks, and square wave voltammetry (SWV), performed under the same conditions as SCV, provided even more reliable identification and quantitation of peaks. Further evidence is provided that DMSO improves the electrode response by unfolding some of the tertiary structure of NOM polymers, thereby allowing greater contact between redox active functional groups and the electrode surface. We averaged experimental peak potentials for all NOM compounds and calculated potentials in water. Average values for Epa1, Epc1, and Ep1 in DMSO were -0.866 ± 0.069, -1.35 ± 0.071, and -0.831 ± 0.051 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and -0.128, -0.613, and -0.0930 V vs. SHE in water. In addition to peak potentials, the breadth of SCV peaks was quantified as a way to characterize the degree to which the redox activity of NOM is due to a continuum of contributing functional groups. The average breadth values were 1.63 ± 0.24, 1.28 ± 0.34, and 0.648 ± 0.15 V for Epa1, Epc1, and Ep1 respectively. Comparative analysis of the overall dataset-from SCV and SWV on all NOMs and model compounds-revealed that NOM redox properties vary over a narrower range than expected based on model compound properties. This lack of diversity in redox properties of NOM is similar to conclusions from other recent work on the molecular structure of NOM, all of which could be the result of selectivity in the common extraction methods used to obtain the materials.},

 abstract = {Gross primary production (GPP) is a key driver of the peatland carbon cycle. Although many studies have explored the apparent GPP under natural light conditions, knowledge of the maximum GPP at light-saturation (GPPmax) and its spatio-temporal variation is limited. This information, however, is crucial since GPPmax essentially constrains the upper boundary for apparent GPP. Using chamber measurements combined with an external light source across experimental plots where vegetation composition was altered through long-term (20-year) nitrogen addition and artificial warming, we could quantify GPPmax in-situ and disentangle its biotic and abiotic controls in a boreal peatland. We found large spatial and temporal variations in the magnitudes of GPPmax which were related to vegetation species composition and phenology rather than abiotic factors. Specifically, we identified vegetation phenology as the main driver of the seasonal GPPmax trajectory. Abiotic anomalies (i.e. in air temperature and water table level), however, caused species-specific divergence between the trajectories of GPPmax and plant development. Our study demonstrates that photosynthetically active biomass constrains the potential peatland photosynthesis while abiotic factors act as secondary modifiers. This further calls for a better representation of species-specific vegetation phenology in process-based peatland models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland carbon cycle.},

We formulated a description of the broader temporal flux pattern in the growing season based on two distinct CH4 source components from slow and fast-turnover carbon. We used automatic closed chamber flux measurements from NE Greenland (74°N), W Greenland (64°N), and Svalbard (78°N) to identify and discuss these components. The temporal separation was well-suited in NE Greenland, where the hypothesized slow-turnover carbon peaked at a time significantly related to the timing of snowmelt. The temporally wider component from fast-turnover carbon dominated the emissions in W Greenland and Svalbard. Altogether, we found no dependence of the total seasonal CH4 budget to the timing of snowmelt, and warmer sites and years tended to yield higher CH4 emissions.},

 abstract = {Groundwater level (GWL) and depth to water (DTW) are related metrics aimed at characterizing groundwater-table positions in peatlands, and two of the most common variables collected by researchers working in these ecosystems. While well-established field techniques exist for measuring GWL and DTW, they are generally difficult to scale. In this study, we present a novel workflow for mapping groundwater using orthophotography and photogrammetric point clouds acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that pockets of surface water are normally abundant in peatlands, which we assume to be reflective of GWL in these porous, gently sloping environments. By first classifying surface water and then extracting a sample of water elevations, we can generate continuous models of GWL through interpolation. Estimates of DTW can then be obtained through additional efforts to characterize terrain. We demonstrate our methodology across a complex, 61-ha treed bog in northern Alberta, Canada. An independent accuracy assessment using 31 temporally coincident water-well measurements revealed accuracies (root mean square error) in the 20-cm range, though errors were concentrated in small upland pockets in the study area, and areas of dense tree covers. Model estimates in the open peatland areas were considerably better.},

 abstract = {Cyclic oxidation and reduction reactions using oxygen and palladium with H2, respectively, of dissolved humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) and model quinone compounds were used to structurally characterize and quantify the electron-carrying capacity (ECC) of reversible redox sites present in humic substances. This technique was used to examine 8 quinone compounds and 14 HA and FA samples and identified 3 redox sites as a function of their stability against the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis process. Six highly aliphatic HA and FA isolated from landfill leachate did not contain redox sites under any conditions; however, the other HA and FA demonstrated reversible redox properties characterized by a combination of three redox sites. On the basis of the model compound results, it is proposed that one site consists of a non-quinone structure (NQ) and the other two sites have quinone structures. The two quinone sites differ in that one group (Q1) has electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the quinone functional group while the second group (Q2) contains either no substituents near the quinone or has nearby electron-donating groups with additional substitutents hindering hydrogenolysis through steric interactions. The reversible ECC of NQ sites ranged from 25 to 265 microequiv e- transferred/g HA or FA, representing 21-56{\%} of the total ECC of the HA and FA when measured with the mildest reducing method (pH 8.0, pure Pd). Q1 redox sites resistant to hydrogenolysis at pH 8.0 using Pd/Al2O3 accounted for 13-58{\%} of the total ECC and ranged from 40 to 120 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA. The most sensitive O2 reversible redox sites accounted for 8-50{\%} of the total ECC (20-220 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA). These results directly demonstrate that HA and FA are capable of acting as reversible electron-transfer agents using different functional groups, some of which may not be quinones.},

 abstract = {High water tables (WT) stabilise peatland carbon (C) through regulation of biogeochemical processes. The impact of peatland WT on ecosystem function, including C exchange, alters over time, and the factors that cause some peatlands to display resilience and others to undergo degradation are poorly understood. Here we use CO2 flux measurements, measured by eddy covariance, to compare ecosystem function between two raised bogs; one drainage-affected, with a deep and fluctuating water table and the other near-natural, with a shallow and stable water table. The drainage-affected bog was found to be a moderate sink for CO2 (69 g C m-2 yr-1), which was 134 g C m-2 yr-1 less than the near-natural bog (203 g C m-2 yr-1). Greater ecosystem productivity has allowed the drainage-impacted bog to act as a CO2 sink despite higher ecosystem respiration; most likely due to an increase in photosynthetic capacity caused by expansion of ericaceous shrub cover. The tolerance of the vegetation community, particularly the main peat former Empodisma robustum (Restionaceae), to low and fluctuating WT appears to have been key in allowing the site to remain a sink. Despite the current resilience of the ecosystem CO2 sink, we found gross primary production to be limited under both high and low water tables, even in a year with typical rainfall. This is best explained by the limited physiological ability of ericaceous shrubs to tolerate a fluctuating WT. As such we hypothesise that if the WT continues to drop and become even more unstable, then without further vegetation change, a reduction in gross primary production is likely which may in turn cause the site to become a source for CO2.},

 abstract = {Landscapes are meaningful ecological units that strongly depend on the environmental conditions. Such dependencies between landscapes and the environment have been noted since the beginning of Earth sciences and cast into conceptual models describing the interdependencies of climate, geology, vegetation and geomorphology. Here, we ask whether landscapes, as seen from space, can be statistically predicted from pertinent environmental conditions. To this end we adapted a deep learning generative model in order to establish the relationship between the environmental conditions and the view of landscapes from the Sentinel-2 satellite. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to generate multispectral imagery given a set of climatic, terrain and anthropogenic predictors. The generated imagery of the landscapes share many characteristics with the real one. Results based on landscape patch metrics, indicative of landscape composition and structure, show that the proposed generative model creates landscapes that are more similar to the targets than the baseline models while overall reflectance and vegetation cover are predicted better. We demonstrate that for many purposes the generated landscapes behave as real with immediate application for global change studies. We envision the application of machine learning as a tool to forecast the effects of climate change on the spatial features of landscapes, while we assess its limitations and breaking points.},

Waterfall plots of the simulated spectral datasets are compared with conventional 2D correlation spectra. Different waterfall plots give different features in differentiating the behaviors of frequency shift versus two overlapped bands. Two-dimensional correlation spectra clearly show the very characteristic cluster pattern for both band position shifts and two overlapped bands. The vivid pattern differences are readily detectable in various waterfalls plots. Various types of waterfall plots of temperature-dependent infrared (IR) spectra of ethylene glycol, which does not have the actual band shift but only two overlapped bands, and of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of 2 wt{\%} acetone in a mixed solvent of CHCl(3)/CCl(4) demonstrate that waterfall plots are not able to unambiguously detect the difference between real band shift and two overlapped bands. Thus, the presence or lack of the asynchronous 2D butterfly pattern seems like the most effective diagnostic tool for band shift detection.},

The cycle voltammetrys of nitrobenzene derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes can be easily tuned by changing the substituted groups of nitrobenzene.

 abstract = {Previous research has shown that long-term intensive cropping of irrigated lowland rice has led to significant grain-yield declines in field trials. The yield decline was attributed to decreased availability of soil nitrogen, which is held mostly in the soil organic matter. By advanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we have detected significant amounts of amide nitrogen directly bonded to aromatic rings in a humic acid fraction extracted from a continually submerged, triple-cropped rice soil. Because nitrogen bonded to aromatics is not readily plant-available, this observation can explain the yield decline. Quantitative (13)C NMR combined with advanced spectral editing showed that this humic acid is rich in lignin derivatives (>45{\%} of all carbon), whereas the corresponding humic acid fraction extracted from an aerobic, single-cropped rice soil contains less lignin and less nitrogen bonded to aromatics.},

 abstract = {Machine-learning algorithms have gained popularity in recent years in the field of ecological modeling due to their promising results in predictive performance of classification problems. While the application of such algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages such as R, there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation, optimization of algorithms using hyperparameter tuning and spatial autocorrelation. We address these issues in the comparison of several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), k-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM). Different nested cross-validation methods including hyperparameter tuning methods are used to evaluate model performances with the aim to receive bias-reduced performance estimates. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease Diplodia sapinea in the Basque Country in Spain is investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil or lithology as predictors. Results show that GAM and RF (mean AUROC estimates 0.708 and 0.699) outperform all other methods in predictive accuracy. The effect of hyperparameter tuning saturates at around 50 iterations for this data set. The AUROC differences between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) performance estimates of the GAM and RF are 0.167 (24{\%}) and 0.213 (30{\%}), respectively. It is recommended to also use spatial partitioning for cross-validation hyperparameter tuning of spatial data.},

Investigate if the antibacterial effect of sphagnan, a pectin-like carbohydrate polymer extracted from Sphagnum moss, can be accounted for by its ability to lower the pH.
METHODS AND RESULTS
Antibacterial activity of sphagnan was assessed and compared to that of three other acids. Sphagnan in its acid form was able to inhibit growth of various food poisoning and spoilage bacteria on low-buffering solid growth medium, whereas sphagnan in its sodium form at neutral pH had no antibacterial activity. At similar acidic pH, sphagnan had comparable antibacterial activity to that of hydrochloric acid and a control rhamnogalacturonan pectin in its acid form.
CONCLUSIONS
Sphagnan in its acid form is a weak macromolecular acid that can inhibit bacterial growth by lowering the pH of environments with a low buffering capacity.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY
It has previously been suggested that sphagnan is an antimicrobial polysaccharide in the leaves of Sphagnum moss with a broad range of potential practical applications. Our results now show that sphagnan in its acid form can indeed inhibit bacterial growth, but only of acid-sensitive species. These findings represent increased knowledge towards our understanding on how sphagnan or Sphagnum moss might be used in practical applications.},

 abstract = {Together, climate and litter quality strongly regulate decomposition rates. Although these two factors and their interaction have been studied across species in continent-scale experiments, few researchers have studied how labile and recalcitrant compounds interact to influence decomposition, or the climate sensitivity of decomposition, within a litter type. Over a period of 3 yr, we studied the effects of warming and altered precipitation on mass loss and compound-specific decomposition using two litter types that possessed similar heteropolymer chemistry, but different proportions of labile and recalcitrant compounds. Climate treatments immediately affected the mass loss of the more recalcitrant litter, but affected the more labile litter only after 2 yr. After 3 yr, although both litter types had lost similar amounts of mass, warming (c. 4°C) and supplemental precipitation (150{\%} of ambient) together accelerated the degradation of alkyl-carbon and lignin only in the more recalcitrant litter, highlighting the role of initial litter quality in determining whether the chemistry of litter residues converges or diverges under different climates. Our finding that labile compounds in litter reduce the climate sensitivity of mass loss and the decomposition of recalcitrant matrix is novel. Our results highlight the potential for litter quality to regulate the effect of climatic changes on the sequestration of litter-derived carbon.},

 abstract = {The electron transfer capacities (ETCs) of soil humic substances (HSs) are linked to the type and abundance of redox-active functional moieties in their structure. Natural temperature can affect the chemical structure of natural organic matter by regulating their oxidative transformation and degradation in soil. However, it is unclear if there is a direct correlation between ETC of soil HS and mean annual temperature. In this study, we assess the response of the electron-accepting and -donating capacities (EAC and EDC) of soil HSs to temperature by analyzing HSs extracted from soil set along glacial-interglacial cycles through loess-palaeosol sequences and along natural temperature gradients through latitude and altitude transects. We show that the EAC and EDC of soil HSs increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Increased temperature facilitates the prevalence of oxidative degradation and transformation of HS in soils, thus potentially promoting the preferentially oxidative degradation of phenol moieties of HS or the oxidative transformation of electron-donating phenol moieties to electron-accepting quinone moieties in the HS structure. Consequently, the EAC and EDC of HSs in soil increase and decrease, respectively. The results of this study could help to understand biogeochemical processes, wherein the redox functionality of soil organic matter is involved in the context of increasing temperature.},

Quantitative agreement between modeling and observations shows extensive peat accumulation before the LGM in northern latitudes (>40°N), particularly during warmer periods including the last interglacial (130 ka to 116 ka, MIS 5e) and the interstadial (57 ka to 29 ka, MIS 3). During cooling periods of glacial advance and permafrost formation, the burial of northern peatlands by glaciers and mineral sediments decreased active peatland extent, thickness, and modeled C stocks by 70 to 90{\%} from warmer times. Tropical peatland extent and C stocks show little temporal variation throughout the study period. While the increased burial of northern peats was correlated with cooling periods, the burial of tropical peat was predominately driven by changes in sea level and regional hydrology. Peat burial by mineral sediments represents a mechanism for long-term terrestrial C storage in the Earth system. These results show that northern peatlands accumulate significant C stocks during warmer times, indicating their potential for C sequestration during the warming Anthropocene.},

@article{Turetsky.2012,
 abstract = {Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries - permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography - and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes.},

 abstract = {During the southern summer season of 2015 and 2016, South Africa experienced one of the most severe meteorological droughts since the start of climate recording, due to an exceptionally strong El Niño event. To investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of surface moisture and vegetation structure, data from ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-1/-2 and NASA’s Landsat-8 for the period between March 2015 and November 2017 were utilized. In combination, these radar and optical satellite systems provide promising data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1 C-band data was exploited to derive surface moisture based on a hyper-temporal co-polarized (vertical-vertical—VV) radar backscatter change detection approach, describing dynamics between dry and wet seasons. Vegetation information from a TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner)-derived canopy height model (CHM), as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, were utilized to analyze vegetation structure types and dynamics with respect to the surface moisture index (SurfMI). Our results indicate that our combined radar–optical approach allows for a separation and retrieval of surface moisture conditions suitable for drought monitoring. Moreover, we conclude that it is crucial for the development of a drought monitoring system for savanna ecosystems to integrate land cover and vegetation information for analyzing surface moisture dynamics derived from Earth observation time series.},

The samples were taken from four hydrologically connected and increasingly sulfidic wetlands within the study site. Parallel trends in EDC values related to hydrologic conditions and to in situ reduced sulfur content were observed by all three methodologies. In particular, it was found that sulfide and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are the primary and secondary reductants, respectively, in these systems. The efficacy of these reductants in transforming organic contaminants, however, is largely driven by native pore water reduced sulfur content. Manipulation of the systems demonstrate that while DOM is capable of reducing highly oxidized contaminants or reactive intermediates, this likely only occurs once the reducing capacity of the sulfide is exhausted. Sulfide therefore was the dominant electron donor in the pore water samples.},

This work presents an automated and highly sensitive flow injection analysis (FIA) system coupled to both spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection to quantify electron-donating phenolic moieties in DOM by determining the number of electrons that these moieties transfer to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(•+)). The FIA system was successfully validated using Trolox as a redox standard. Highest method sensitivity was attained when combining the FIA with chronoamperometric detection, resulting in limits of quantification of picomolar amounts of Trolox and nanogram amounts of DOM (corresponding to solutions with <1 mg carbon per liter). The analysis of DOM isolates showed a strong linear correlation between the number of electrons donated and their titrated phenol contents, supporting oxidation of phenols by ABTS(•+). The broad application spectrum of the FIA system to dilute natural DOM samples was illustrated by analyzing water samples collected from northern peatlands and by monitoring the oxidation of phenols in one peat sample upon incubation with a phenol oxidase. The superior analytical capability of the FIA system allows quantifying phenols and monitoring phenol dynamics in dilute DOM samples.},

This work advances a flow-injection analysis system coupled to chronoamperometric detection to allow for the simultaneous and highly sensitive determination of these moieties in dilute DOM samples. Analysis of anoxic pore water and oxic pool water samples collected across an ombrotrophic bog in Sweden demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and quinone moieties in peat DOM. The pore water DOM had higher quantities of phenolic but not quinone moieties compared with commonly used model aquatic and terrestrial DOM isolates. Significantly lower phenol content in DOM from oxic pools than DOM from anoxic pore waters indicated oxidative DOM processing in the pools. Consistently, treatment of peat DOM with laccase, a phenol-oxidase, under oxic conditions resulted in an irreversible removal of phenols and reversible oxidation of hydroquinones to quinones. Electron transfer to peat DOM was fully reversible over an electrochemical reduction and subsequent O2-reoxidation cycle, supporting that quinones in peat DOM serve as regenerable microbial electron acceptors in peatlands. The results advance our understanding of redox processes involving phenolic and quinone DOM moieties and their roles in northern peatland carbon cycling.},

@article{Ward.2010,
 abstract = {There is concern that changes in climate and land use could increase rates of decomposition in peatlands, leading to release of stored C to the atmosphere. Rates of decomposition are driven by abiotic factors such as temperature and moisture, but also by biotic factors such as changes in litter quality resulting from vegetation change. While effects of litter species identity and diversity on decomposition processes are well studied, the impact of changes in relative abundance (evenness) of species has received less attention. In this study we investigated effects of changes in short-term peatland plant species evenness on decomposition in mixed litter assemblages, measured as litter weight loss, respired CO(2) and leachate C and N. We found that over the 307-day incubation period, higher levels of species evenness increased rates of decomposition in mixed litters, measured as weight loss and leachate dissolved organic N. We also found that the identity of the dominant species influenced rates of decomposition, measured as weight loss, CO(2) flux and leachate N. Greatest rates of decomposition were when the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris dominated litter mixtures, and lowest rates when the bryophyte Pleurozium schreberi dominated. Interactions between evenness and dominant species identity were also detected for litter weight loss and leachate N. In addition, positive non-additive effects of mixing litter were observed for litter weight loss. Our findings highlight the importance of changes in the evenness of plant community composition for short-term decomposition processes in UK peatlands.},

@article{Warden.2017,
 abstract = {The transition from hunter-gatherer-fisher groups to agrarian societies is arguably the most significant change in human prehistory. In the European plain there is evidence for fully developed agrarian societies by 7,500 cal. yr BP, yet a well-established agrarian society does not appear in the north until 6,000 cal. yr BP for unknown reasons. Here we show a sudden increase in summer temperature at 6,000 cal. yr BP in northern Europe using a well-dated, high resolution record of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Baltic Sea. This temperature rise resulted in hypoxic conditions across the entire Baltic sea as revealed by multiple sedimentary records and supported by marine ecosystem modeling. Comparison with summed probability distributions of radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites indicate that this temperature rise coincided with both the introduction of farming, and a dramatic population increase. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the boundary of farming rapidly extended north at 6,000 cal. yr BP because terrestrial conditions in a previously marginal region improved.},

While experiments have shown that LPMOs are copper dependent enzymes requiring an electron donor, the mechanism and origin of the electron supply in biological systems are only partly understood. We show here that insoluble high molecular weight lignin functions as a reservoir of electrons facilitating LPMO activity. The electrons are donated to the enzyme by long-range electron transfer involving soluble low molecular weight lignins present in plant cell walls. Electron transfer was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showing that LPMO activity on cellulose changes the level of unpaired electrons in the lignin. The discovery of a long-range electron transfer mechanism links the biodegradation of cellulose and lignin and sheds new light on how oxidative enzymes present in plant degraders may act in concert.},

 abstract = {Introduction -- Getting Started with ggplot2 -- Toolbox -- Mastering the Grammar -- Building a Plot Layer by Layer -- Scales, Axes and Legends -- Positioning -- Themes -- Data Analysis -- Data Transformation -- Modelling for Visualisation -- Programming with ggplot2 -- Index -- R Code Index

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:< • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

 abstract = {Humin (HM) is a complex mixture of molecules produced in the different biological processes, and the structural evolution of HM in the agricultural wastes composting are not well-known. Elucidating and comparing the structural evolution during livestock manure (LMC) and straw wastes (SWC) composting can help one to better understand the fates, features, and environmental impacts of HM. This study exploits excitation emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC), two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-CoS), hetero-2DCoS, and structural equation model (SEM) to compare the fate of the HM. We fit a three-component EEM-PARAFAC model to characterize HM extracted from LMC and SWC. The results show that the HM evolution has a significant difference between LMC and SWC. As a result, the opposite change tendency and different change order of HM fluorescent components determine the different synthesis formation and evolution mechanisms. The diverse organic matter composition and dominant microbes might be the reason for the different evolution mechanism. Based on these results, a comprehensive view of the component changes of HM in the composting process is obtained. Furthermore, the superior potential of such an integrated approach during investigating the complex evolution in the environment was also demonstrated.},

 abstract = {Peatlands are spatially heterogeneous ecosystems that develop due to a complex set of autogenic physical and biogeochemical processes and allogenic factors such as the climate and topography. They are significant stocks of global soil carbon, and therefore predicting the depth of peatlands is an important part of establishing an accurate assessment of their magnitude. Yet there have been few attempts to account for both internal and external processes when predicting the depth of peatlands. Using blanket peatlands in Great Britain as a case study, we compare a linear and geostatistical (spatial) model and several sets of covariates applicable for peatlands around the world that have developed over hilly or undulating terrain. We hypothesized that the spatial model would act as a proxy for the autogenic processes in peatlands that can mediate the accumulation of peat on plateaus or shallow slopes. Our findings show that the spatial model performs better than the linear model in all cases-root mean square errors (RMSE) are lower, and 95{\%} prediction intervals are narrower. In support of our hypothesis, the spatial model also better predicts the deeper areas of peat, and we show that its predictive performance in areas of deep peat is dependent on depth observations being spatially autocorrelated. Where they are not, the spatial model performs only slightly better than the linear model. As a result, we recommend that practitioners carrying out depth surveys fully account for the variation of topographic features in prediction locations, and that sampling approach adopted enables observations to be spatially autocorrelated.},

@article{Zhang.2020,
 abstract = {Northern boreal peatlands are important ecosystems in modulating global biogeochemical cycles, yet their biological communities and related carbon dynamics are highly sensitive to changes in climate. Despite this, the strength and recent direction of these feedbacks are still unclear. The response of boreal peatlands to climate warming has received relatively little attention compared with other northern peatland types, despite forming a large northern hemisphere-wide ecosystem. Here, we studied the response of two ombrotrophic boreal peatlands to climate variability over the last c. 200~years for which local meteorological data are available. We used remains from plants and testate amoebae to study historical changes in peatland biological communities. These data were supplemented by peat property (bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content), 14 C, 210 Pb and 137 Cs analyses and were used to infer changes in peatland hydrology and carbon dynamics. In total, six peat cores, three per study site, were studied that represent different microhabitats: low hummock (LH), high lawn and low lawn. The data show a consistent drying trend over recent centuries, represented mainly as a change from wet habitat Sphagnum spp. to dry habitat S. fuscum. Summer temperature and precipitation appeared to be important drivers shaping peatland community and surface moisture conditions. Data from the driest microhabitat studied, LH, revealed a clear and strong negative linear correlation (R2 ~=~.5031; p~<~.001) between carbon accumulation rate and peat surface moisture conditions: under dry conditions, less carbon was accumulated. This suggests that at the dry end of the moisture gradient, availability of water regulates carbon accumulation. It can be further linked to the decreased abundance of mixotrophic testate amoebae under drier conditions (R2 ~=~.4207; p~<~.001). Our study implies that if effective precipitation decreases in the future, the carbon uptake capacity of boreal bogs may be threatened.},

@article{Zheng.2013,
 abstract = {Mercuric ion, Hg(2+), forms strong complexes with thiolate compounds that commonly dominate Hg(II) speciation in natural freshwater. However, reactions between dissolved aqueous elemental mercury (Hg(0)aq) and organic ligands in general, and thiol compounds in particular, are not well studied although these reactions likely affect Hg speciation and cycling in the environment. In this study, we compared the reaction rates between Hg(0)aq and a number of selected organic ligands with varying molecular structures and sulfur (S) oxidation states in dark, anoxic conditions to assess the role of these ligands in Hg(0)aq oxidation. Significant Hg(0)aq oxidation was observed with all thiols but not with ligands containing no S. Compounds with oxidized S (e.g., disulfide) exhibited little or no reactivity toward Hg(0)aq either at pH 7. The rate and extent of Hg(0)aq oxidation varied greatly depending on the chemical and structural properties of thiols, thiol/Hg ratios, and the presence or absence of electron acceptors. Smaller aliphatic thiols and higher thiol/Hg ratios resulted in higher Hg(0)aq oxidation rates than larger aromatic thiols at lower thiol/Hg ratios. The addition of electron acceptors (e.g., humic acid) also led to substantially increased Hg(0)aq oxidation. Our results suggest that thiol-induced oxidation of Hg(0)aq is important under anoxic conditions and can affect Hg redox transformation and bioavailability for microbial methylation.},
